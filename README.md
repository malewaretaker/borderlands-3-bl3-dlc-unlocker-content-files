**Legit DLC Unlocker for Epic Game Store version of Borderlands 3**

It works by hooking a function that parses json string of entitlements.
The unlocker automatically fetches DLC IDs and adds them to the original list.
Users can use blacklist option in config to disable automatically fetched DLCs.
Users can also inject additional DLC IDs in the config file.
Config file is entirely optional. All fields within the config file are optional too.
